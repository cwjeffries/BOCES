# Project BOCES
Student/Teacher task and log client

## Description
This is a small Windows form c# program I created.

It was design to be used by students of varying age/ability and teachers.

## Functionality
Students: Enter log in screen and view picture and name associated with a teacher, 
once they find their's a list of students associated with that teacher displays in
a datagridview each with a name and a picture as well. From there they can login
with a button and that takes them to a screen with task names/pictures and a simple
start/end task button to track when and how long they did it.

Teachers/Admins: Similarly with above teachers can help students do those actions.
Additionally, there is an admin login in the lower right corner. This will take anyone
with access to a page that allows creating/deleting/updating students, teachers, and tasks.
There is also a specific area for adding pictures to any of the three and finally a screen
for printing a report with all task data currently stored in the database.
